# Software engineering Assigment #2 "Learning Plan"
### Abstract

The following document is the assignment 2 for the course “software engineering” ,by the student Stefanos Stefanou(ID :27020363) .
The main purpose of this document is to “engineer” the “way to degree” of the creator ,finding the “best path” of aquiring his degree 
and finally , achieve his dreams. 
The main problem what we will try to approach this problem is the way of gathering knowledge in order to take his degree , 
with respect on the current future goals and  dreams (in order to become a computer science researcher). We will approach this problem
as it was a standard-industry problem, by using industry-standard techniques and tools ,we will try find the best(but not necessarily 
the shortest) learning path possible.

### Introduction

Acquiring the needed knowledge is a complicated problem , and many today’s students don’t approach it at all. 
Instead they take decisions “on-demand” without a central and well defined plan . 
This is usually a source of unwanted side-effects , such as problems on further studies (some universities
require for example industrial year for every Master or PHD programme) , or even worse, lack of essential knowledge ,
mandatory for the tomorrow’s IT Job. This document will be a first approach to create a <<learning map>> by taking all the 
important decisions in advance. This will allow us to see our <<trip to success>> overall and predict/prevent possible failures in the future . 
We will define our Degree as the desired <<Product>> and we will decompose it ,level by level, in order to include the best possible 
set of <<features>> (we define as <<feature>> the set of acquired knowledge ,or more specific, the choosen modules) , 
detecting milestones and dependencies(explained below).This is not a trivial task . We have a lot of constraints to consider 
in order our solution to be a valid one. For example every part(year) has a limit on credits(every “feature” (module) has a 
number of credits , denoting the work needed in hours) ,as well as various dependencies , such as Pre-requisites(Modules that we must 
completed in order to take other modules) and excluded modules(Some modules make impossible to take another modules in the future parts). 
At first I will gather all the required knowledge, such as module descriptions and dependencies, and I will decide the 
universities that I want to apply for a master. Secondly I will apply the gathered information and I will create two PBS 
(Project Breakdown Structure) structures, one Time-Oriented and one Depedency-Oriented(The exact reason is explained below).After that I will 
present a Gannt chart describing the timing and the study periods for each module. 
Additionally i will include as a baseline my CV (as I use it for over two years) and I will include a reflection section , 
disguising the overall experience as well as the nature of task and the difficulties I encountered .
Finally a short discussion about what I have learned and how I approach the learning as a procedure will follow.

### Background
Stefanos Stefanou is a student of the University of Reading at the time .
He loves everything have done with science and especially mathematics and computers . It started <<playing>> with computer at
the age of 10 , and in the first years he mastered on how to destroy them , by using every possible and creative way. 
At the age of 11 he started playing with the windows command line and by the age of 12 he wrote his first games in python 
and pygame(SDL wrapper in python) . From very young age he loved the freedom that programming offers, the access he offers into 
pure creativity in a way that nothing else has every give to him. By the age of 13 he started playing with C and C++ and he doesn’t 
stop ever since . By the age of 17 he achieved to take the 30rd position into Pan-Hellenic Competive Computer Competition. 
He succeeded into Pan-Hellenic exams(equilevant of Standard A-Levels in Greece) and he achieved to enter in the <<University of
Western Attica (UniWa)>> . But it wasn’t very satisfied with his studies and he applied in the University of Reading in order to 
push himself into his limits .He wants to work on research and spend his days inventing and creating new knowledge . 
Believes that creating new knowledge is the ultimate “mission” and he tries every day to be better in order to achieve this goal.
 
### The CV 
My CV as i used for over two years will follow. you can find the on-line version on ( http://stefanos.freebsdworld.gr/ )

### The Project Breakdown Structure('s)
The following section will decompose the desired product (Degree) into its fundamental elements, the modules. 
In order to have a complete overview , I approached the decomposition from 2 views , 
the first view is more time-oriented , and provides a more structured and elegant way of viewing the internals of the degree .
This approach is clearly more readable and way more stuctured,but due to its nature ,
it cant provide any information about module dependencies . This approach is represented below
![The Time-Oriented PBS](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/ru020363/Software-enginnering-2/raw/master/DegreePBS_TIME.jpg)

Because of the limitations of the Time-oriented PBS , i created a second PBS witch is definitely more depedency-oriented.
As we will se , there are 3 main types of depedency(..in the available modules i choose). 
The modules that is depedent on "Mathematics for computer science"(Part 1) , the modules that is depedent on 
"Applications of Computer Science"(Part 1) and "Programming"(Part 1), and the non-depedent modules.
The Depedency-Oriented PBS will follow

### The Gannt Chart
We define as milestone , every part (year) and every term of the degree. 
This decision will help us break this huge period of 3 years into smaller and manageable periods.
In order to keep the chart as small and simple as possible , a time unit of months is selected. 
Here I need to notice that the gannt chart represents the study-lecture periods abstracted . That means that ,
if a module has 10 credits and it taught at autumn and spring terms. Then the study period is autumn and spring , 
and the 100 hours of total work(10 credits=100 hrs)  will be equally divided between the corresponding weeks .
I will not include that information because that will make the gannt chart unnecessary complex 
The formalised "study-plan" follows!

### Reflections
As i said previously in the introduction , the task of creating a learning map wasn’t a trivial one, due to its nature 
there are so many choices with so many dependencies , this lead to a ton of outcomes and possible failures and vice versa .
Despite the difficulty of the process, the way of approaching this problem using standard software industry tools learned 
me how to tackle such problems as an engineer. When I started dealing with this problem , I was thinking all the time that 
“this problem isn’t a engineering problem , so It cant be solved with industry  tools”,
but as I progressed further into I realized that every problem has a core , and these tools
( PBS,Gannt e.t.c ) is made to deal exactly with this core of each problem. Every problem has some entities , 
some dependencies(relations) with these entities , and every problem can be subdivided into smaller and more approachable  problems.
This realization made me more confident to approach every given problem from now on. This is a essential skill not only in engineering 
but in the real life also. It can , for example help me dealing with the University itself. The University has a way more different way 
to give knowledge , in a way more relaxed way. This is fundamentally different than the system used by school .In school , the whole
system enforced us to succeed and push every student to success . The university is different , is there to take the knowledge , 
but it doesn’t enforce you to take it. This is difficult for every student starting university out there. Everyone thinks that the 
university is easier in the start , and everyone knows how this end. This coursework gave me the key to tackle this new relaxed and
uncertain system , by give me  standard way to solve any given problem, such as how to study( this is a problem for a gannt chart!)
and how to acquire the base-knowledge I need in order to can attend a course ( this is a problem that can be solved using a PBS) .
The university is different , it requires to be there and take the knowledge , no one will enforce you to do anything, this is hard
at the beginning and requires a strong level of organization . The organize part isn’t a easy task(this is a whole field of science
these days , we call it management ) so any student struggle at first to find a way to organize itself. This coursework gave me the
tools to accomplish that in a elegant and efficient way.
